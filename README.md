**Enron Fraud Case: Identifying Person of Interest (POI) using Machine Learning Tools**

For this project, we utilize machine learning skills to choose a algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email datasets. At the minimum, the best machine learning algorithm chose will have precision and recall scores of at least 0.3.

**Project Overview**

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud due to misleading accounting practices. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. 

Using Machine Learning tools, we built a best model for a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. The dataset provided by Udacity has the persons of interest in the fraud case tagged, which is defined by individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.
